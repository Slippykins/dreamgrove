<b>Notes</b>

A pure single target fight, Natureâ€™s Balance is nice due to the natural downtime of the fight, but Warrior of Elune can be useful in dealing with movement. Mass Entanglement is the most viable choice in the tier 60 row as you can Entangling Root the Spark Boots, and also Mass Entangle them at the same time. Tiger Dash is potentially very powerful due to its ability to cover a large distance quickly and short cooldown. This is useful for bringing the Gigavolt Charge to safety without harming your raid.
