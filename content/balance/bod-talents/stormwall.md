<b>Notes</b>

A primarily single target oriented fight with priority add spawns, We advise you take Warrior of Elune to deal with the short bursts of movement that you canâ€™t fully prepare for. Make sure to pool Astral Power for add spawns accordingly. Tiger Dash can be useful in dealing with short bursts of movement and also clearing the Freezing Tidepools in phase 2.
