<b>Notes</b>

This boss starts out quite cleave heavy but eventually leads to multiple single target damage checks. What this means is you have a choice to make in the tier 90 talent row, weighing Stellar Flare vs Twin Moons based on how much multi target damage you need. Make sure to pool Astral Power to burst down the totems spawned throughout the fight.
