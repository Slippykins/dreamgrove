<b>Notes</b>
 
Conclave of the Chosen is primarily a single target focused fights with intermittent add spawns and periods of heavy movement and damage. Be sure to be positioned to fully DoT up all adds that spawn in opposite sections of the room and use either Mighty Bash or Typhoon to slow their movement towards their target. Be careful knocking them too close to each other as it will buff the adds. Watch your raid frames as their is a curse debuff in which we can dispel that will periodically be applied to allies in which they can receive no healing. Warrior of Elune is recommended to burst down add spawns and also minimize damage loss while kiting them.
