<b>Notes</b>

A single target boss with strong add focus, itâ€™s recommended to take full single target talents with the possible exceptions of Force of Nature and Fury of Elune which can be used to increase your DPS to the high priority adds that spawn throughout the fight if needed. Due to the immense damage dealt by Grong to both the raid and the tanks, we suggest using both Swiftmend and Wild Growth when needed and if the damage is too high, also take Renewal. Starlord is potentially quite useful for added priority damage, especially due to the low movement nature of the fight.
