It is heavily recommended you sim your character regardless of what guides say as that is almost always the best way to know if something is an upgrade as your best stats depend completely on your specific character.

Intellect is your primary stat, it will be on almost all of your gear besides jewelry and some trinkets, usually you don’t want to sacrifice too much item level for secondaries stats as it is not worth losing too much intellect. Otherwise your secondary stat priority will usually look something like so: 

- **Haste >= Mastery > Critical Strike > Versatility**

### Enchants:

- {{< item 159786 "Enchant Weapon - Quick Navigation" "beta" >}} or {{< item 153479 "Enchant Weapon - Torrent of Elements" "beta" >}} (Depending on what sims higher)
- {{< item 153443 "Enchant Ring - Pact of Haste" "beta" >}}

### Consumables: 

- {{< item 152639 "Flask of Endless Fathoms" "beta" >}}
- {{< item 163222 "Battle Potion of Intellect" "beta" >}}
- {{< item 156526 "Bountiful Captain’s Feast" "beta" >}} or {{< item 154884 "Swamp Fish ‘n Chips" "beta" >}}

### Sockets: 

- One {{< item 153709 "Kraken’s Eye of Intellect" "beta" >}} 
- {{< item 154127 "Quick Owlseye" "beta" >}} in your remaining slots.

### Notable trinkets you should consider are the following: 

- Any trinket that is of high item level.
